                                   I&rsquo;m passionate about building open-source stuff and teaching people to code. I have started my professional web development journey building web apps using
                                   Reactjs, Nextjs and Nodejs. I love exploring new technologies and playing around with them and to contribute to the open source community by creating tools which can
                                   be helpful to the community, doing photography & sketching in my spare time, listening to some music which ranges from rock to pop and going around with my friends.{" "}
